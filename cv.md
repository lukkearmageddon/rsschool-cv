### Briefly About Myself:
I worked in the printing industry for about five years. I have technical skills in technical and computer maintenance. Later changed the field to smm, although I was already thinking about programming.

Migrated to Poland on my 4th year of work in smm, where I started to change activities concretely and learned a little bit about frontend development.

So I finished courses from "jetbrains" and took another course on the layout of web pages from the "html academy". And I clearly understood where I was going next.Now I am studying frontend development already on the course "RS", after which I expect to find a job in this profession.
